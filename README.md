Your reaction is completely valid—workplace conversations can carry subtle undertones, and it’s natural to question whether you experienced a **microaggression** or just an awkward interaction. Let’s break down what happened and how you might approach it:

---

## **1. Understanding Microaggressions**

**Microaggressions** are subtle, often unintentional, comments or behaviors that communicate a bias or dismissiveness, especially toward someone perceived as an outsider or “other.” They can be based on gender, race, age, or even professional status.

- **Examples:** “You need to do X, but I don’t,” or “It’s harder for some people to keep up,” can imply that you’re less capable or that your struggles are unique or self-inflicted.

## **2. Analyzing the Conversation**

- **You:** Asked for advice on routines and time blocking—a collegial, professional inquiry.
- **Him:** Responded by distinguishing himself: “You need to time block, but I don’t.”
- **Impact:** His comment separates you from him, suggesting he’s above the need for a strategy you require, which can feel patronizing or dismissive.

**Why it feels off:**  
- It implies a hierarchy of competence or effort.
- It doesn’t acknowledge that different people have different working styles or workloads.
- It subtly undermines your approach without offering real support.

## **3. Was It a Microaggression?**

- **Intent vs. Impact:** He may not have intended to offend, but the impact was that you felt dismissed or “othered.”
- **Pattern:** If this is a one-off, it might just be thoughtlessness or ego. If it happens repeatedly (from him or others), it may reflect a deeper bias about who “needs” certain tools or support.

## **4. How to Respond or Move Forward**

### **A. Reflect**
- Ask yourself: Was this an isolated incident, or do you notice a pattern of similar comments?
- How do you want to feel at work, and what boundaries do you want to set for conversations like this?

### **B. Address Directly (If Comfortable)**
If you feel safe, you can address the comment the next time something similar happens, either in the moment or privately:
- **In the moment:**  
  *“Interesting—why do you think time blocking is good for me but not for you?”*
- **Privately:**  
  *“I noticed in our conversation you suggested I need to time block but you don’t. I’d love to hear more about your approach, but I also want to make sure we’re supporting each other as peers.”*

### **C. Set Boundaries**
- If you encounter similar comments in the future, it’s okay to redirect or close the conversation:  
  *“Thanks for your input. I’ll figure out what works best for my workflow.”*

### **D. Seek Allies**
- Share your experience with a trusted colleague or mentor. Sometimes, others can validate your feelings or share their own strategies for handling subtle dismissiveness.

### **E. Document (If It Becomes a Pattern)**
- If you start to notice a pattern of microaggressions or undermining comments, keep a private log. This helps if you ever need to escalate or seek support.

| Address Directly | “Why do you think I need it, but you don’t?”             |

**Final Thought:**  
You’re not “too sensitive” for noticing this. Microaggressions can be subtle but have a real impact on morale and team cohesion. Trust your instincts, and don’t be afraid to advocate for yourself and your preferred ways of working.
